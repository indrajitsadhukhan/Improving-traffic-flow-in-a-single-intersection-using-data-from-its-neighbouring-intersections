# Improving-traffic-flow-in-a-single-intersection-using-data-from-its-neighbouring-intersections
It is a project build on Simulation Of Urban Mobility(SUMO) to simulate a single intersection and optimize the traffic by minimizing queue lengths and waiting time using Traci (Traffic Control Interface). It is a real-time traffic solution which can be used to minimize traffic on a single intersection.
