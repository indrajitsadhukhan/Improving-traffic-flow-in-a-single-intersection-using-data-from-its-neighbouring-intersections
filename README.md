# Improving-traffic-flow-in-a-single-intersection-using-data-from-its-neighbouring-intersections
It is a project build on Simulation Of Urban Mobility(SUMO) to simulate a single intersection and optimize the traffic by minimizing queue lengths and waiting time using Traci (Traffic Control Interface). It is a real-time traffic solution which can be used to minimize traffic on a single intersection.

Road traffic congestion is one of the greatest problem in metropolitan cities. It costs lot of time and money for people who suffers from traffic in their daily life.


Some negative effects of traffic congestion are:
Wasting time of motorists and passengers ("opportunity cost"). As a non-productive activity for most people, congestion reduces regional economic health.
Delays, which may result in late arrival for employment, meetings, and education, resulting in lost business, disciplinary action or other personal losses.
Inability to forecast travel time accurately, leading to drivers allocating more time to travel "just in case", and less time on productive activities.
